            The Katoki Legacy
          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Born from the Katoki Foundation, KIUL carries forward the legacy of
            Katoki: a commitment to holistic development, ethical leadership, and
            the flourishing of communities. Ubuntu-driven leadership means
            understanding that a leader’s strength is inseparable from the
            wellbeing of their people—progress measured not by titles, but by
            shared uplift, belonging, and justice.
